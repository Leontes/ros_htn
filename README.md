# ROS_HTN
**ros_htn** is a Hierarchical Tasks Planner for the Robotic Operative System (ROS). **ros_htn** contains the functionality needed to solve planning problems in PDDL 2.1 using the HPDL extension [\[Castillo2006\]](#castillo2006) in a ROS nodes architecture. **ros_htn** contains 2 nodes: **plan_service_node** the ros service responsible for calling the HTN planner and return a plan, and **domain_updater_node** the node used to update the planner's domain.

## Requirements <a id="requirements"></a>
* Ubuntu 16.04
* ROS Kinetic Kame
* GCC with C++11

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>
Starting in a ROS Workspace folder, type:
```bash
cd src/
git clone https://github.com/Leontes/ros_htn.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
catkin_make
```

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>
ROS_HTN comes with a launch file ready to be executed and used. This launch will execute ros_core and the plan_service and domain_updater nodes when used setting as default domain a domain passed as the launch argument. If no planning domain is given **ros_htn** will use by default the **domain.pddl** file located in the **planningfiles** folder. When passing a new domain as input you must provide the full path to the new file in order to make **ros_htn** correctly set the new domain file. The **domain_updater** node is subscribed to the _/dom_updater_ topic to receive new domains. Launch file can be executed from the command line as follows:

```bash
roslaunch ros_htn htn_server.launch domain:="pathtodomain/newdomain.pddl"
```
To send a planning problem to the planning server it must be properly formatted. This format is defined in the **PlanningProblem.msg** file stored in msg folder and consists of 3 parts: the world's objects definition, the initial state of the world and a goal. World's objects are defined as an array of pairs _<object, type>_. The initial state is defined as a list of logic statements in PDDL [\[McDermont1998\]](#mcdermont1998) format. In PDDL boolean logic statements (fluents) are defined as _(predicate object1 ... objectN)_ and numeric logic statements (functions) as _((fluent) value)_. Finally, the goal of a problem is a list of tasks that must be solved. This tasks must be also written in PDDL format as _(task_name argument1 ... argumentN)_. The file **planner_test_client.cpp** contains a test example problem for the domain contained in the **planningfiles** folder. It can be executed by running the node **planner_test_client** of the **ros_htn** package.

In **planner_test_client.cpp** we can see perfectly differentiated the definition of the three components of a planning domain. Such as the objects definition:

```c++
ros_htn::PlanningProblem problem;

ros_htn::Object obj;
std::vector<ros_htn::Object> objectsVec;

obj.objName = "general";
obj.objType = "lander";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "rover0";
obj.objType = "rover";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "rover0store";
obj.objType = "store";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "waypoint0";
obj.objType = "waypoint";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "waypoint1";
obj.objType = "waypoint";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "waypoint2";
obj.objType = "waypoint";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "camera0";
obj.objType = "camera";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

obj.objName = "objective0";
obj.objType = "objective";
objectsVec.push_back(obj);

problem.objects = objectsVec;
```

The initial state construction:

```c++
std::vector<std::string> state;

state.push_back("(at_soil_sample waypoint1)");
state.push_back("(at_rock_sample waypoint2)");
state.push_back("(visible_from objective0 waypoint2)");
state.push_back("(calibration_target camera0 objective0)");
state.push_back("(in_sun waypoint2)");
state.push_back("(at_lander general waypoint0)");
state.push_back("(channel_free general)");
state.push_back("(visible waypoint0 waypoint1)");
state.push_back("(visible waypoint0 waypoint2)");
state.push_back("(store_of rover0store rover0)");
state.push_back("(empty rover0store)");
state.push_back("(equipped_for_rock_analysis rover0)");
state.push_back("(equipped_for_soil_analysis rover0)");
state.push_back("(equipped_for_imaging rover0)");
state.push_back("(visible waypoint1 waypoint2)");
state.push_back("(on_board camera0 rover0)");
state.push_back("(supports camera0 colour)");
state.push_back("(supports camera0 high_res)");
state.push_back("(supports camera0 low_res)");
state.push_back("(= (energy rover0) 5000)");
state.push_back("(= (recharge-rate rover0) 5)");
state.push_back("(at rover0 waypoint0)");
state.push_back("(available rover0)");
state.push_back("(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint1)");
state.push_back("(can_traverse rover0 waypoint0 waypoint2)");
state.push_back("(can_traverse rover0 waypoint1 waypoint2)");

problem.initState = state;
```

And the goal tasks addition:

```c++
std::vector<std::string> tasks;

tasks.push_back("(sample rover0 waypoint1)");
tasks.push_back("(sample rover0 waypoint2)");
tasks.push_back("(photo rover0 objective0 high_res)");

problem.goal = tasks;
```
